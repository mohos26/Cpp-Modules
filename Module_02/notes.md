Fixed-Point

Advantages:

Simpler and faster in arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division via shifting).

Low resource consumption (suitable for simple hardware and embedded systems).

Disadvantages:

Very limited range.

Low precision with very large or very small numbers.

Floating-Point

Advantages:

Very wide range (from very small to very large numbers).

Higher precision in scientific and engineering calculations.

Disadvantages:

Slower than fixed-point (because operations are more complex).

Consumes more resources (memory, power, time).
